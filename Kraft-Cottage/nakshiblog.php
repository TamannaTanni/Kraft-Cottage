  Nakshi kantha is a form of folk art that dates back to our earlier history in regard to its origin.
  It is basically a quilt but made with heavy patterned hand embroidery. Previously, old sarees and
  thread used to be the materials for a typical Katha, but today new clothes have replaced that
  in order to meet the huge market demand. Nakshi Katha has many types of designs, stitches, and uses. Animals,
  flowers, birds, symbols, mythical figures, or geometrical patterns fill up each canvas gracefully.

  Speciality

  One might ask, what is so special about Nakshi Katha when so many other embroidery works crowd up the market these
  days? Well, here’s the twist….Nakshi Wall mat Every Nakshi Katha happens to have a background story. In fact, the origin of
  Nakshi Katha did not even begin with any commercial intention. It all started in some lazy afternoon at the hands of some
  village housewives stitching up their heart onto the old sarees. Thus, every Katha tells a different tale. A random Katha
  might take you back to a typical village scenario by portraying a shepherd, kolshi, village ladies, river or much more.
  Another canvas will perhaps reflect some rural woman’s mind rhythm or a regular picture of dheki, palki, shanai, marriage
  ceremony – all fetched from some particular event happened in the artist’s life.


  Global Fascination

  One can find the mention of Nakshi Katha in Krishnadas Kaviraj’s book to Zaman’s writing (Zaman, 2012). This artistic
  marvel is immensely entwined with our roots &Nakshi stitched saree culture. Till this day, many families believe that
  draping a newborn baby with a Nakshi Katha will protect the child (Bangla Crafts, 2008). The most intriguing fact about
  Nakshi Katha is that it is impossible to find two similar pieces of this in the whole world. Just like a Jamdani saree,
  our gifted weather and high-quality yarn make it easier to produce this uniqueness. One can see thousands of Mona Lisa
  paintings in the world, but only the real Mona Lisa will ever preserve its aura. In the same manner, a single Nakshi
  Katha’s creative aura is never going to lose. From Queen Elizabeth to President G.W. Bush, many prominent figures have
  a Nakshi Katha in their collection (Nakshi Katha, 2012).


  Wind of Change

  Today, by the course of time, the usage, pattern, materials and even the stitches of Nakshi Katha have changed. Gut
  taaga, Panch taaga, Lahori Katha, Necklace border are only a few to name in the world of this creativity (Nakshi
  Katha or Kantha, 2018). Quran cover, puja floor spread, pillow cover, prayer mat, handkerchief, wallet & many other
  upholstery, décor, and clothing items are being hand embroidered in Nakshi pattern these days. Time has changed,
  so has our taste, yet this traditional art found its rightful place back in the fashion trend anyway.


  Making a Nakshi Katha

  Making a Katha involves time, precision & patience. The old sarees or cloth pieces are layered one after another
  by perfectly shaping, sizing and smootheningAn artisan sewing Nakshi pattern in such manner that no crease is left
  between (Bengal Craft, 2008). The stitches and patterns are also quite intricate. When the appropriate canvas is
  formed, the alpona starts. It takes months to finish working on a single king-sized Nakshi Katha. Traditionally,
  women used to make Kathas in their leisure time, but later on, out of its emerging demand, they started doing it
  as part of their occupation.
